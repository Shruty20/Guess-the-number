# Guess-the-number

This Python program is a simple number guessing game where the player attempts to guess a random number between 1 and 200. The game offers two difficulty levels: easy and difficult. In the easy level, the player has more turns to guess the number, while in the difficult level, they have fewer turns.

How to Play:

Run the program.
Choose the game difficulty level: 'easy' or 'difficult.'
The program will generate a random number as the answer.
You have a limited number of turns to guess the correct number.
After each guess, you'll receive feedback on whether your guess was too high or too low.
Keep guessing until you either guess the correct number or run out of turns.
Implementation Details:

The program uses Python's random module to generate random numbers.
It provides clear instructions to the player at each step.
The number of turns is set according to the chosen difficulty level.
The game loop continues until the player guesses the correct number or exhausts all turns.
Have fun playing and see if you can guess the number correctly!
